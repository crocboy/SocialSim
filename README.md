SocialSim
=========

A social simulator.  

This program creates its own 'world' in which virtual people live. 
It was created to model social interactions.

More importantly, it was created to have a world in which we can reign supreme control over our virtual minions.


Currently, people in this 'world' do nothing more than live and then die.  In between that, they make babies.

It'll get better.
